			<u><strong>SEDS Mission Statement:</strong></u><br />
				  <em><strong>SEDS</strong> is an independent, student-based organization which   promotes the exploration and development of space. <strong>SEDS</strong> pursues this   mission by educating people about the benefits of space, by supporting a network   of interested students, by providing an opportunity for members to develop their   leadership skills, and inspiring people through our involvement in space-related   projects. <strong>SEDS </strong>believes in a space-faring civilization and that focusing   the enthusiasm of young people is the key to our future in space.</em>

			<u>History of SEDS:</u><br />
				<em>Students for the Exploration and Development of Space was   founded in 1980 at MIT and Princeton and consists of an international group of   high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from a diverse range of   educational backgrounds who are working to promote space as a whole. <strong>SEDS </strong>is a chapter based organization with chapters throughout the United States,   Canada, United Kingdom, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The permanent   National Headquarters for <strong>SEDS-USA</strong> resides at MIT. Each chapter is fairly   independent and coordinates activities and projects in its own area.  </em>

			<strong><u>What do SEDS Members do?</u></strong><br />
				<em><strong>SEDS </strong>members are people interested in doing as much   as they can to promote space exploration and development. The first step in this   continual process is learning. <strong>SEDS </strong>provides an excellent environment in   which to obtain access to many sources of information including speakers, tours,   films, discussion groups &amp; daily NASA updates. Astronomical observing trips   and tours of local space facilities also play a significant role in the life of   many <strong>SEDS</strong> members. </em>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<em><strong>SEDS</strong> members often take the knowledge they have   gained and use it to influence the future of the space program. Students at   several chapters have played major roles in organizing large conferences and   have established important contacts with members of the space community. Others   have helped increase public awareness of the benefits of space exploration by   offering presentations to local primary and secondary schools as well as   universities. All chapters keep in contact with each other through on-line   computer networks. </em>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<em>Finally, <strong>SEDS</strong> provides an environment in which people   of common interests can relax and freely discuss issues important to them. </em>
		</p>
			  
		<p><strong><u>What do SEDS Members do?</u></strong><br />
			<em><strong>SEDS</strong> can provide an organized pathway for you to begin   space related projects and give you a chance to break away from the usual class   work. You can also use <strong>SEDS </strong>as a stepping stone to a space-related   career. Being actively involved in <strong>SEDS</strong> can put you in touch with many   members of the space, technology, and education community and will allow you to   develop the experience necessary to take leadership roles in your future career,   whatever that may be.</em>
